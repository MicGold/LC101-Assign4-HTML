                <h2>The Family:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li class="familyMember"><strong>Michaela:</strong> the food giver and scratchies provider. 
                        She doesn't fully believe she's an adult quite yet,
                        but she's doing her best for these two little floof balls.
                    </li>
                    <li class="familyMember"><strong>Dallas:</strong> The smallest, but also the bravest and boldest. 
                        She hates to be picked up or moved against her will, 
                        but she'll love to the fullest once you win her trust.
                    </li>
                    <li class="familyMember"><strong>Poirot:</strong> The craziest and the cuddliest. 
                        He literally runs up the walls at times, 
                        but he's also quick to run up and give a loving head butt to a new friend.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>The Story Begins</h2>
                <p>Despite living in a little apartment and not <em>technically</em> allowed to have pets, one look at Poirot's handsome little mustache and Dallas' tiny pink nose and Michaela was a goner.
                    The months-long pandemic also didn't help. Two bundles of energy and fur help make quarentine go by faster and life a little more joyful.
