Assignment 4: HTML and CSS

Your mission is to build a page that:

Tells a story. This can be personal or impersonal, funny, serious or neither. You can do whatever you like, but it should be something in the range of 3-10 paragraphs or sections.

HTML should do each of the following:
<p>Uses each of the following structural HTML tags: <ul>
<li>p,</li>
<li>header,</li> 
<li>footer,</li> 
<li>main,</li> 
<li>article.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Uses at least one img tag (hopefully more). 
  -images stored in a subfolder called images within html-me-something directory.</p>
<p>Uses at least one HTML entity.</p>
<p>Demonstrates creativity. Don’t stop with these items or tags. Have some ideas for your page, and make it great.</p>

<p>CSS must:</p>
Use margin and padding to space your elements in a visually pleasing way.
<p>Use at least one of each of the following types of selectors: 
<ul>
<li>element,</li> 
<li>class,</li> 
<li>id.</li>
</ul></p>
Follow these rules:
<ul>
  <li>Avoid adding HTML elements in order to achieve a specific visual effect.</li>
  <li>Use document-level and inline styles sparingly, and only when absolutely necessary.</li>
  <li>Be creative! Make your page look great, and don’t just settle for checking off the items above.</li>
